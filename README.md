# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project develops a **classification model** to predict **bank customer churn**. It uses preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior and identify at-risk clients.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Feature selection & transformation
- Applied classification models
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## 📊 Results
- Built models to predict churn with good accuracy
- Identified key factors influencing customer churn

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdulrafey7/Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
